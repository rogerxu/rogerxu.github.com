Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not require a DOM.

## Concept

### Suites

A test suite begins with a call to the global Jasmine function `describe`.

    describe("A suite", function() {
        it("contains spec with an expectation", function() {
            expect(true).toBe(true);
        });
    });

### Specs

Specs are defined by calling the global Jasmine function `it`.

### Expectations

Expectations are built with the function `expect` which takes a value, called the actual. It is chained with a Matcher function, which takes the expected value.

#### Matchers

Each matcher implements a boolean comparison between the actual value and the expected value. It is responsible for reporting to Jasmine if the expectation is true or false. Jasmine will then pass or fail the spec.

Any matcher can evaluate to a negative assertion by chaining the call to `expect` with a `not` before calling the matcher.

    it("can have a negative case", function() {
        expect(false).not.toBe(true);
    });


### Asynchronous

## Mocking Framework - Jasmine Spy

    var spy = spyOn(console, "log");

[How to Setup QUnit](http://vesapui5.dhcp.wdf.sap.corp:1080/trac/sapui5/wiki/InternalDocumentation/TestingEnvironment/HowToSetupQUnit)

UI5 implemented a bridge JSUnit to QUnit which is responsible to collect the status information of the QUnit tests and report them back into the JSUnit framework.

## QUnit

**Why does UI5 use Qunit tests?**

QUnit tests have been proven to provide a much better support for asynchronous testing in comparision to JSUnit. These kind of tests are often needed for UI functional tests (e.g. wait until rendering is done, some animations complete or a backend call returns) but are complicated to create via JSUnit and are error-prone.

A QUnit test page can be executed standalone in the browser without the need of an additional "tool" like the JSUnit Testrunner. This eases the creation and execution of single QUnit tests.

Finally QUnit is closely related to jQuery (which is also included in UI5).

**Why does UI5 use JSUnit Testrunner?**

The JSUnit Testrunner can be easily integrated into the Maven build (Lean DI) environment to execute our JavaScript unit tests each build. The result of the Testrunner execution finally creates a report in the Maven surefire format which can be used for reporting purposes of a Hudson build server or a Sonar quality system or at least cause a Maven build to break. Also the JSUnit Testrunner is not using any JS shell (e.g. like Jasmine which is using Rhino) furthermore it opens a browser as a process with a parameter containing the site to load and finally waits until the browser submits the results to the Testrunner server. Another interesting usage of the JSUnit Testrunner is that you can cluster your tests in testsuites.

## Scrum

* Story Point

### Project Management - Progress

* Sprint Planning
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective
* Daily Scrum
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Team
* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog

### Agile Software Development - Code Quality

* Test-Driven Development
* Clean Code
* Refactoring
* Pair Programming
* Continuous Integration
* Simple Design
* Collective Code Ownership
* Acceptance Tests
* Exploratory Testing

## Software Quality

### External Quality (user's perspective)

* Correctness
* Performance
* Usability
* Security

### Internal Quality (developer's perspective)

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Extensibility
* Reusability
* Testability

### Downsides of Low Internal Quality

* Internal quality continues to decline
  * "Broken Window" effect
* External quality suffers
* Productivity decreases
  * New features are hard to implement
  * More and more effort is wasted on bug fixes

### How to Get High Internal Quality

* Do not accumulate technical debt
  * Clean up everything as soon as possible
  * Adapt architecture and design as needed instead of adding workarounds
  * Do not live with "Broken Windows"
  * Automate recurring tasks
* Have a common understanding of quality and design within the team
* Define "done" adequately

## Test Isolation

Test Case -> Code Under Test -> Depended On Component

### Testing without Isolation

* Object - A bug here can cause test failures
* Third party library
* DB - Wrong data can cause test failures
* Dependencies - Must exist, otherwise testing is impossible

### Test Double Patterns

* Object -> Mock Object
* Third party library -> Stub
* DB -> Fake DB
* Dependencies -> Dummy

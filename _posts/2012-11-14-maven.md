# Maven

## Installation

### m2eclipse

## Configuration

### User Configuration

`~/user/.m2/settings.xml`

### Project Configuration

`pom.xml`

## Run

### Profile

    mvn help:active-profiles

Now if we have something like a profile in the settings.xml that has been set as an active profile and also triggered a profile in the POM.

    mvn help:active-profiles -P test.build

This will list the activated profiles:

    The following profiles are active:

     - env_win_default (source: pom)
     - env_win_amd64 (source: pom)
     - test.build (source: pom)
     - snapshot.build (source: settings.xml)

## SSH

Generate SSH Keys

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "roger.xu.2007@gmail.com"
    # Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
    # Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    # Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

    Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
    # Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    # The key fingerprint is:
    # 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com

Add SSH key to GitHub

    $ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    # Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

Add SSH public key to server

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ vi authorized_keys
    $ chmod 600 authorized_keys
    $ cat authorized_keys

Test SSH

    $ ssh -T git@github.com
    # Attempts to ssh to github


## Configuration

    $ git config [Config file location] [Action]

Config file location

* `--system` - use system config file - `$GIT_HOME/etc/gitconfig`
* `--global` - use global config file - `$USER_HOME/.gitconfig`
* `--local` - use repository config file - `$git_repository/.git/config`
* `-f, --file <file>` - use given config file

### Set Configuration

    $ git config --local --list
    $ git config --local --edit
    $ git config --local --get http.proxy
    $ git config --get-all http.proxy
    $ git config --local http.proxy "http://localhost:8087"
    $ git config --local --unset http.proxy
    $ git config --local --unset-all http.proxy

### HTTP Proxy

Set the proxy for git at 'system' level (so that the 'jenkins' can read the config as well):

    $ git config --system http.proxy "http://localhost:8087"
    $ git config --system https.proxy "http://localhost:8087"
    $ git config --system git config --system http.sslverify false
    $ git config --system --get http.proxy
    $ git config --get-all http.proxy

### Line Endings

`core.autocrlf`

* true - Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings
* input - Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings
* false - Checkout as-is, commit as-is

    $ git config --global core.autocrlf input


Using `text` attribute in [.gitattributes](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitattributes.html) file in the root of the repository. This file overrides the `core.autocrlf` setting.

`text=auto`

This setting will tell git to handle the files specified automatically.

`text`

This setting tells git to always normalize the files specified. When committed they are stored with LF, on checkout they are converted to the OS's native line endings.

`text eol=crlf`

This setting tells git to normalize the files specified on commit, and always convert them to CRLF on checkout. You should use this for files that must retain CRLF endings.

`text eol=lf`

This setting tells git to normalize the files specified on commit, and always convert then to LF on checkout. You should use this for files that must retain LF endings.

`binary`

This setting tells git that the files specified are not text at all, and it should not try to change them. The `binary` setting 

Example:

    # Set default behaviour, in case users don't have core.autocrlf set.
    * text=auto

    # Explicitly declare text files we want to always be normalized and converted 
    # to native line endings on checkout.
    *.c text
    *.h text

    # Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout.
    *.sh text eol=lf

    # Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
    *.bat text eol=crlf
    *.ini text eol=crlf

    # Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
    *.png binary
    *.jpg binary
    *.gif binary
    *.bmp binary
    *.ico binary

### Change URL

* `url.<base>.insteadOf`

    $ git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/


## Clone Repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/rogerxu/rogerxu.github.com.git
    $ cd rogerxu.github.com
    $ git remote -v
    $ git remote set-url origin https://rogerxu@github.com/rogerxu/rogerxu.github.com
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git hist --all
    $ git merge origin/master

## Commit Change

    $ git add .
    $ git status
    $ git diff
    $ git commit -m "Add files."
    $ git commit --amend --reset-author


### Storage Efficiency

Git does not store file deltas. Although you added only a single line to the end of a file, Git stored that new content as a completely new object. You have two nearly identical 4K objects on your disk. The initial format in which Git saves objects on disk is called a loose object format. However, occasionally Git packs up several of these objects into a single binary file called a packfile in order to save space and be more efficient. Git does this if you have too many loose objects around, if you run the git gc command manually, or if you push to a remote server.

When a new object (e.g. a file with previously unseen contents) enters the system, it is stored with plain (zlib) compression as a “loose object”. When enough loose objects accumulate (based on the gc.auto configuration option; or when the user runs git gc or one of the lower-level packing commands), Git will collect many loose objects into a single “pack file”.

Objects in a pack file can be stored either as plain compressed data (same as a loose object, just bundled up with others objects), or as compressed deltas against some other object. Deltas can be chained together to configurable depths (pack.depth) and are can be made against any suitable object (pack.window controls how widely Git searches for the best delta base; a version of an historically unrelated file can be used as a base if doing so would yield a good delta compression). The latitude that the depth and window size configurations give the delta compression engine often result in a better delta compression than the CVS-style simple one-version-against-the-next/previous-version “diff” compression.

It is this aggressive delta compression (combined with normal zlib compression) that can often let a Git repository (with full history and an uncompressed working tree) take less space than a single SVN checkout (with uncompressed working tree and pristine copy).


## Push Change

Syntax: `git push <repository> <refspec>`

    $ git push origin master:master

* `<refspec>` - The format is the source ref `<src>`, followed by a colon `:`, followed by the destination ref `<dst>`. -- `<src>:<dst>`

The `<src>` is often the name of the branch you would want to push.

The `<dst>` tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this push. If `:<dst>` is omitted, the same ref as `<src>` will be updated.

    $ git push origin master

Gerrit push:

    $ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master


## Shared Repository

Create a bare repository

    $ cd ~
    $ git init --bare --shared=all foo.git
    $ chgrp -R dev foo.git


Clone git repository

    $ git clone ssh://git@localhost/~/foo.git foo

## Submodule

### Add a submodule

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/getify/LABjs.git src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs

There will be a `.gitsubmodule` file stores info about the parent git and submodule git.

    [submodule "src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs"]
        path = src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
        url = https://github.com/getify/LABjs.git

Commit this change.

    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)
    #
    #       new file:   .gitmodules
    #       new file:   src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
    #

    $ git add .gitmodules src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
    $ git commit -m "Add submodule into version control"

Initialize the submodules, i.e. register each submodule name and url found in `.gitmodules` into `.git/config`.

    $ git submodule init

### List submodule

    $ git submodule

### Update submodule

Update the registered submodules, i.e. clone missing submodules and checkout the commit specified in the index of the containing repository.

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

Pull changes for each submodule.

    $ git submodule foreach git pull

Commit submodule changes.

    $ git add src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
    $ git commit -m "Update a submodule"

### Remove submodule

    $ git rm --cached src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
    $ rm -rf .git/modules/src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
    $ rm -rf src/main/webapp/vendor/LABjs
    $ vim .gitmodules
    $ vim .git/config

    $ git add .gitmodules
    $ git commit -m "Remove a submodule"
    $ git submodule sync

## Hooks

Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client side and server side. The client-side hooks are for client operations such as committing and merging. The server-side hooks are for Git server operations such as receiving pushed commits.

### Installing a Hook

The hooks are all stored in the `hooks` subdirectory of the Git directory. In most projects, that's `.git/hooks`.

To enable a hook script, put a file in the `hooks` subdirectory of your Git directory that is named appropriately and is executable. From that point forward, it should be called.

### Push notification from repository

To minimize the delay between a push and a build, it is recommended to set up the `post-receive` hook in the repository to poke Jenkins when a new commit is made. To do this, add the following line in your `hooks/post-receive` where "URL of the Git repository" is the fully URL you use to clone this repository.

    curl http://yourserver/jenkins/git/notifyCommit?url=<URL of the Git repository>[&branches=branch1[,branch2]*]


Edit `repository.git/hooks/post-receive`

    #!/bin/sh
    # Push notification from repository to poke Jenkins when a new commit is made.

    curl http://cnpvg50809797vm10.dhcp.pvgl.sap.corp:8080/jenkins/git/notifyCommit?url=ssh://git@cnpvg50809797vm10.dhcp.pvgl.sap.corp/~/tam-web.git

And change the mode for `post-receive` script to make it executable.

    $ chmod 775 post-receive

This will scan all the jobs that's configured to check out the specified URL, the optional branches, and if they are also configured with polling, it'll immediately trigger the polling (and if that finds a change worth a build, a build will be triggered in turn.) We require the polling configuration on the job so that we only trigger jobs that are supposed to be kicked from changes in the source tree.

This allows a script to remain the same when jobs come and go in Jenkins. Or if you have multiple repositories under a single repository host application (such as Gitosis), you can share a single post-receive hook script with all the repositories. Finally, this URL doesn't require authentication even for secured Jenkins, because the server doesn't directly use anything that the client is sending. It runs polling to verify that there is a change, before it actually starts a build.

When successful, this will return the list of projects that it triggered polling as a response.

### UI 1st Approach

This a learning from the past when functionality was in the focus and we followed the Service 1st approach. In the UI 1st approach the UI interaction designer is providing the wireframes and the UI developer is building the app based on mock data without any access to a backend system. With the mock data most functions of the app can be used and validated by the end user. This is the basic idea: validate the app with the end user in an early stage. When the app is validated and accepted then the corresponding OData service model will be implemented by the backend developer.

### 10 Golden Rules for Fiori Development

[Golden Rules for SAP Fiori Applications](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/fioritech/Golden+Rules+for+SAP+Fiori+Applications)

1. SAP Fiori apps must have an approved UX design.
2. SAP Fiori UIs are build with SAPUI5.
3. SAP Fiori apps are based on OData services.
4. One SAP Fiori app - one OData service. - [Details](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/fioritech/GR04%3A+1+Fiori+app+-+1+dedicated+OData+service)
5. SAP Fiori UIs and OData services must be defined in different software components.
6. Every SAP Fiori app is defined by a set of metadata.
7. No custom CSS is allowed for SAP Fiori apps. - [Details](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/fioritech/GR07%3A+No+custom+CSS+allowed)
8. Every SAP Fiori app must run as a web app.
9. Every SAP Fiori app must run in the SAP Fiori Launchpad.
10. Every SAP Fiori app must run on mobile devices along the native app paradigm.


Any Fiori App addresses a particular user role. No multi functional UI any longer.
Classical feature-rich applications served different user with different roles. Fiori-apps are targeted and designed for the scope of a specific role.

### Charts

[VizFrame](http://veui5infra.dhcp.wdf.sap.corp:8080/sapui5-sdk-dist/explored.html#/entity/sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame/properties)

The standard library for all charts is sap.viz. The CVOM SDK should only be used where a particular chart type cannot be created by customizing the SAPUI5 viz charts. MAKIT should NOT be used.

### Maps

[Guidelines for Maps - Use of Visual Business](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/fiorisuite/Guidelines+for+Maps+-+Use+of+Visual+Business)

Use Visual Business (sap.ui.vbm) for all full geo and analytical maps.

With 1.22, Visual Business now offers an analytical map. This analytical map uses a JSON vector file for content like countries, regions etc.

### Reference Applications

## Theming / CSS Usage

## Data Binding

### Date & Time data types

OData V2 does not comprise a pure Date data type. For date properties type Edm.DateTime should be used with annotation sap:display-format="Date". For timestamp properties (containing date and time) type Edm.DateTimeOffset should be used. (In OData V4 types Edm.DateTime and Edm.Time will be retired - instead there are new types Edm.Date, Edm.TimeOfDay and Edm.Duration).
